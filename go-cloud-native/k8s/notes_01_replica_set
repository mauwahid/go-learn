ReplicaSets can be used independently as Pod controllers but they only offer a limited set of features. A set of complementary features are provided by Deployments, the recommended controllers for the orchestration of Pods. Deployments manage the creation, deletion, and updates of Pods. A Deployment automatically creates a ReplicaSet, which then creates a Pod. There is no need to manage ReplicaSets and Pods separately, the Deployment will manage them on our behalf.
